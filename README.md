# Overview
This is convenience layer on top of JPA Criteria API which allows to write following queries:
```java
QEmployee_ employee = new QEmployee_();
List<Employee> employees = query.select(Employee.class)
				.where(employee.fullName.like("John%"))
				.orderBy(employee.age.asc())
				.limit(20, 10)							
				.getResultList();
```
Design goals used during creation of this library:
* Reuse all available JPA functionality and infrastructure
* Be simple and minimalistic so that any developer was able to change library code just after few hours of code investigation. Version 1.x used JPA metamodel which imposes serious limitations on the possible query syntax. Version 2.x work with own custom generated metamodel. Main motivation for generating own metamodel is to improve query syntax compared to version 1.x. 
* Provide simpler, more convenient and shorter syntax compared to JPA Criteria API 

# Quick Start
## Add Dependency
Add dependency to your project:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.sveryovka</groupId>
    <artifactId>easy-criteria</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
## Generate Metamodel
Metamodel is generated by ```easycriteria.meta.modelgen.JPACriteriaProcessor``` class which is Java annotation processor and is invoked during build process. For each JPA entity class own metamodel class will be generated using following naming pattern "Q" + className + "_". If you do not have Java annotation processors explicitly disabled for your build this annotation processor will be triggered automatically. All you have to do is to have "easy-criteria" added as dependency.

## Write Query
You need to have instance of JPA Entity Manager to create and execute query
```java
List<Employee> employees = new JPAQuery(entityManager).select(Employee.class).getResultList();
``` 

# Examples
## Simple query
```java
QEmployee_ employee = new QEmployee_();
List<Employee> employees = query.select(employee)
				.where(employee.fullName.like("John%"))
				.orderBy(employee.age.asc())
				.limit(20, 10)				
				.getResultList();
```
Please pay attention that before executing query you need to create instance of metamodel class ```QEmployee_``` to be able to use it in query. 

## Paging
API has two methods:
```
limit(int rowCount)

limit(int offset, int rowCount) 

```
Example:
```java
List<Employee> employees = query.select(Employee.class)				
				.limit(20, 10)				
				.getResultList();
```


## Complex WHERE clause
To reproduce SQL query
```sql
select * from employee 
        where 
        fullName = 'Something' 
		 or (fullName = 'Other 1' and age = 5)
		 or (fullName = 'Name 1' and age = 1)'
```
you need to use following Java code
```java

QEmployee_ employee = new QEmployee_();
List<Employee> employees = query.select(Employee.class)
				.where(
					employee.fullName.eq("Something")
					.or(
						employee.fullName.eq("Other 1")
						.and(employee.age.eq(5))
					).or(
						employee.fullName.like("Name 1")
						.and(employee.age.eq(1))
					)
				)
				.getResultList();
```

## JOIN support
Object model:
```java
@Entity
public class Project {
	
	private String name;
	...
	@OneToOne
	private HomeAnimal homeAnimal;
}

@Entity
public class HomeAnimal extends Animal {
	
	private String owner;
	...
}
```
We want join "Project" and "HomeAnimal" and filter results where ```homeAnimal.owner ="owner1"```
```java
QLargeProject_ largeProject = new QLargeProject_();
QHomeAnimal_ homeAnimal = new QHomeAnimal_();

List<LargeProject> projects = query.select(LargeProject.class)
				.join(largeProject.homeAnimal, JoinType.INNER, homeAnimal)
				.where(homeAnimal.owner.eq("owner1"))
				.getResultList();
```
In this example when we perform join ```join(largeProject.homeAnimal, JoinType.INNER, homeAnimal)``` we specify join type ```JoinType.INNER``` and join table alias ```homeAnimal``` which is later used to filter results.

## Subquery
To create instance of "subquery" you need to have instance of "query" created first. 
```java
		QEmployee_ employee = new QEmployee_();		
		
		EasyCriteriaQuery<Employee, Employee> query = new JPAQuery(entityManager).select(Employee.class);
		EasyCriteriaSubquery<Employee, Integer> subQuery = query.subquerySelect(employee.id).where(employee.fullName.eq("fullName1"));
		List<Employee> emp = query.where(employee.id.in(subQuery)).getResultList()
```

## Limitations
Currently map joins are not supported. Use JPA API directly to construct queries which require map joins.
